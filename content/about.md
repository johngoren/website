# Hi, I'm John Gorenfeld.

I'm a freelance software engineer and book author from California who lives in London, UK.

If you're interested, here are [projects](./) I've worked on.

I'm a '90s guy (he/him) so I believe in changing the world, making things on the Web, and listening to Pavement. Lately I've been working on software for a South Sudan human rights project. I also co-founded [Tesla Takedown UK](www.teslatakedown.co.uk). I'm Small Tech. I like taking on big engineering challenges but I also like fulfilling causes. Some of the niches I've enjoyed working in: encrypted chat software, wildlife databases, and journalism.

 I'm not really on social media! But here's my [email](mailto:john@gorenfeld.net).
